# collectd-varnishstat #

A simple python module for collectd to fetch Varnish statistics.
Since the official collectd Varnish module for collectd often is incompatible with the latest Varnsish release,
you can use this to fetch statistics instead.
Just the most common stats from varnishstat are enabled by default, but you can easily enable more by adjusting the
filter.
